# EasyGelAlyzer

**EasyGelAlyzer** is a lightweight desktop application for quantitative analysis of gel electrophoresis images. It supports both protein (SDS-PAGE) and DNA gel modes, providing band position measurement, Rf value calculation, standard curve fitting, and molecular weight (or bp size) estimation — all within a single GUI.

---

## Features

- **Dual analysis modes** — Switch between Protein (SDS-PAGE, kDa) and DNA (agarose gel, bp)
- **Interactive image viewer** — Zoom, pan, rotate, and adjust brightness/contrast of gel images
- **Start/End line setup** — Place migration distance reference lines by clicking or dragging
- **Molecular weight marker registration** — Click marker bands and enter known sizes; the standard curve updates automatically
- **Sample band measurement** — Click a sample band to automatically estimate its size from the standard curve
- **Standard curve fitting** — Linear regression of log₁₀(size) vs. Rf with R² display; manual coefficient override supported
- **Lane labels** — Add draggable lane labels (MW marker / sample) above the gel image
- **Layer panel** — Toggle visibility and export status per annotation item; supports renaming, reordering, and deletion
- **Excel export** — Export marker data, sample results, and the standard curve graph to a multi-sheet `.xlsx` file
- **Annotated image export** — Save the gel image with all annotations drawn; multiple layout options available
- **Project save / load** — Save all measurement data and the image to a `.gelproj` JSON file to resume later
- **Undo / Redo** — 20-step history for image state
- **Drag & drop** — Drop image files directly onto the canvas (requires `tkinterdnd2`)
- **Bilingual UI** — Switch between English and Japanese at startup

## Installation

### Option A — Use a pre-built executable (recommended)

Download the latest `EasyGelAlyzer_version.zip` from the [Releases](../../releases) page, extract it, and double-click `EasyGelAlyzer.exe` or the provided shortcut. No Python or additional library installation is required.

### Option B — Build from source

To clone the repository and build the executable yourself:

1. **Set up the environment**

   The following are required:
   - **Python 3.9 or later**
   - **Windows** (required by PyInstaller)

   Install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow numpy matplotlib openpyxl pyinstaller
   pip install tkinterdnd2   # Optional — required for drag & drop support
   ```

2. **Run the build script**

   Execute `exe_build.bat` located in the repository root:
   - Double-click to run, or
   - Run from a terminal:
     ```bat
     exe_build.bat
     ```

3. **What the build script does**

   `exe_build.bat` performs the following steps automatically:
   - Reads the version number from `src/version.py`
   - If Git is available:
     - `git add .`
     - `git commit -m "Build vX.Y.Z"`
     - `git tag vX.Y.Z`
   - Creates a temporary build environment in the TEMP directory to avoid PyInstaller issues with non-ASCII paths
   - Runs PyInstaller and bundles:
     - `src/main.py`
     - `src/assets/` (icons, etc.)
   - Copies the finished `EasyGelAlyzer.exe` to the local `dist/` folder
   - Automatically creates `EasyGelAlyzer.lnk` (a shortcut)
   - Removes the temporary build folder

4. **Build output**

   On success, the following are generated:
   - `dist/EasyGelAlyzer.exe`
   - `EasyGelAlyzer.lnk` (shortcut)

   Use either of these to launch the application.

5. **Notes**
   - The build will abort if `src/version.py` does not exist.
   - The script is designed to build reliably even in environments with non-ASCII (e.g. Japanese) paths.
   - Icons inside `src/assets/` are automatically embedded into the exe.
   - If Git is not installed, the commit and tagging steps are skipped.

## Dependencies (required only for building)

| Library | Version |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.9+ |
| Pillow | ≥ 9.0 |
| NumPy | ≥ 1.21 |
| Matplotlib | ≥ 3.5 |
| openpyxl | ≥ 3.0 |
| PyInstaller | ≥ 5.0 |
| tkinterdnd2 | Optional (drag & drop) |

---

## Quick Start

1. **Launch** — Double-click `EasyGelAlyzer.exe` (if building from source, run `exe_build.bat` first).
2. **Select mode** — Choose **Protein (kDa)** or **DNA (bp)** in the startup dialog.
3. **Open an image** — Go to *File → Open Image*, or drag a JPEG / PNG / TIFF gel image onto the canvas.
4. **Set reference lines** — Click *Set Start Line* and click the top edge of the gel, then click *Set End Line* and click the dye front (or bottom of migration).
5. **Add markers** — Click *Add Marker*, then click each marker band and enter its known size.
6. **Check the standard curve** — Verify the R² value in the standard curve panel (R² ≥ 0.95 is recommended).
7. **Add samples** — Click *Add Sample*, then click each sample band; sizes are estimated automatically.
8. **Export** — Use *Export → Excel* for tabular data, or *Export → Annotated Image* for figures intended for papers or reports.
9. **Save** — Use *File → Save Project* (`.gelproj`) to save all data and resume later.

## Standard Curve Calculation

The Rf value is calculated as:

```
Rf = (band y-coordinate − start line y-coordinate) / (end line y-coordinate − start line y-coordinate)
```

Linear regression is then performed:

```
log₁₀(size) = a × Rf + b
```

Unknown sizes are estimated using:

```
size = 10^(a × Rf + b)
```

If no markers are available, you can manually enter coefficients `a` and `b` directly in the standard curve panel.

---

## Export Details

### Excel (`.xlsx`)

Three sheets are generated:
- **Standard Curve sheet** — Marker name, Rf, size, log₁₀(size)
- **Results sheet** — Sample number, sample name, Rf, estimated size
- **Graph sheet** — Embedded standard curve graph image

### Annotated Image

You can select and output from four different layouts.

Black and white mode and margin trimming options are also available.

Start lines, end lines, molecular weight markers, sample markers, and labels can be excluded from the output image by unchecking the checkboxes in the Layers tab.

The eye icon in the Layers tab toggles the display on the operation screen and does not affect the output image.

## Configuration File

User settings (such as language preference) are stored at:

```
~/.EasyGelAlyzer/gel_config.json
```

This file is created automatically on first launch.
